# Real World Database Project - Data and Applications Project

## E-Commerce website

We aimed to build a near-realistic E-Commerce database platform. Almost all functionality mentioned in the requirements doc in phase 1 has been implemented, and the CLI is in a near-perfect state.

## Command Line Inrerface
